# FiveAds
Mobile Android Application called, "Five Ads / 5 Ads". The idea is to make people watch ads, only five times per day, and to give them tickets. And with these tickets, they can earn prizes.

Apparently this idea is againt google admob's policy and this app got my account banned.

I have since just made this app a simple messaging app using firebase.

All the messages are deleted every 7 days to save space on the server storage.

All the ad id's in the code are banned so I left them in there.

This project used to be close sourced, but I have since made it open source in case anyone wants to learn from it.
